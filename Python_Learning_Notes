5.1.5

message = 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.'
count = {}

	count.setdefault(character, 0)
	count[character] = count[character] + 1

print(count)

5.3.1

theBoard = {'top-L': 'O', 'top-M': 'O', 'top-R': 'O',
'mid-L': 'X', 'mid-M': 'X', 'mid-R': ' ',
'low-L': ' ', 'low-M': ' ', 'low-R': 'X'}

How can I print the image out?
